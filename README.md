# Deep Learning - CS 7150

In the CS 7150 deep learning course, we explored a diverse range of topics, spanning from the fundamentals of deep neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, Generative Models, and Adversarial Attacks. Advanced topics included Graph Neural Networks and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Practical applications covered Object Detection, Image Segmentation, and seq2seq learning. The course also delved into self-supervised training in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision.

Throughout the semester, participants completed three projects, each started from scratch. These projects focused on Fully-Connected and Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformers, as well as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Adversarial Attacks. Additionally, my final project centered on the implementation of Muzero and Alphazero.
